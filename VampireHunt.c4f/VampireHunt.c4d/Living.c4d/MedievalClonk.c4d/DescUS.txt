The clonk is the prefered victim of vampire. He can be drunk, made to a ghoul or because of boredom easily be killed.

But he knows how to struggle: He can fight against vampire with axe, sword, burning arrows and lances. And if he is unconscious you can kill him with the stilt.

Be careful: You can kill a clonk not easily but heavy strikes will beat him up quickly and then he is a big victim. And if you are tired it is bad for your performance.
